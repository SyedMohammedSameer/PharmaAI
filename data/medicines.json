    "contraindications": "Pregnancy (teratogenic, abortifacient)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:50]{index=50}; breastfeeding; alcoholism or chronic liver disease (due to hepatotoxicity risk); pre-existing blood dyscrasias (like bone marrow hypoplasia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) in non-malignant use; immunodeficiency (for rheumatoid/psoriasis use); during significant infections",
    "side_effects": "Stomatitis (oral ulcers), nausea, GI upset; elevated liver enzymes, hepatotoxicity (especially long-term, in psoriasis/RA monitor LFTs, risk of cirrhosis); bone marrow suppression (leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia) dose-dependent; infection risk; pulmonary toxicity (pneumonitis) which can be idiosyncratic; rash, photosensitivity; alopecia; folate deficiency (hence folic acid supplementation recommended in low-dose therapy); in high-dose chemo, severe toxicities (mucositis, kidney injury, etc. mitigate with leucovorin rescue). Also can cause fatigue and malaise on dose days. Long-term low-dose can cause nodulosis or other weird effects in RA. Tumor lysis syndrome if treating malignancy with high tumor burden",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Folate antimetabolite that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, thereby preventing formation of tetrahydrofolate, which is necessary for purine and thymidine synthesis. In cancer, this leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell replication, especially in rapidly dividing cells. In rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, the mechanism is partly due to anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects (e.g., promotes adenosine release, affects cytokine production) beyond the antiproliferative effect on immune cells",
    "drug_interactions": "Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole can significantly increase methotrexate toxicity (both inhibit DHFR, plus TMP can reduce MTX clearance)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:51]{index=51}; NSAIDs and penicillins can reduce renal elimination of MTX (especially high-dose) and increase toxicity; loop diuretics may elevate MTX levels; other folate depleting drugs increase toxicity; live vaccines should be avoided; leucovorin (folinic acid) rescues normal cells from MTX (used intentionally in high-dose regimens, but if given inadvertently in RA dosing would reduce efficacy); cyclosporine with MTX can increase toxicity of both; alcohol should be avoided due to liver risk; proton pump inhibitors can affect renal elimination of MTX (especially high dose IV) causing increased levels; highly protein-bound drugs like salicylates or phenytoin can displace MTX from albumin and increase active levels"

    "name": "Taxol",
    "generic_name": "Paclitaxel",
    "manufacturer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb",
    "dosage": "Varies by regimen/cancer: e.g., for ovarian cancer: 175 mg/m^2 IV over 3 hours every 3 weeks; for breast cancer (adjuvant) often 80 mg/m^2 IV weekly ×12; requires premedication (dexamethasone, H1 and H2 blockers) to prevent hypersensitivity. Dose adjustments for neutropenia or neuropathy",
    "indications": "Various cancers: ovarian carcinoma (first-line and recurrent); breast cancer (adjuvant or metastatic); non-small cell and small cell lung cancer; AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma; off-label for others like pancreatic (in combo nab-paclitaxel), etc. It's a broad-spectrum cytotoxic agent often used in solid tumors",
    "contraindications": "Neutrophils <1500 cells/µL (for solid tumor therapy, hold until counts recover); severe hypersensitivity to paclitaxel or Cremophor EL (castor oil derivative solvent) – patients with severe reaction should not be re-challenged; pregnancy (teratogenic/fetal toxic)",
    "side_effects": "Neutropenia (dose-limiting, can be severe), leukopenia; peripheral neuropathy (often sensory, cumulative dose dependent); alopecia (often total body hair loss); nausea, vomiting (mild to moderate); hypersensitivity reactions (due to Cremophor solvent, can be severe - hence premedication is required); mucositis; arthralgias/myalgias a few days after infusion; bradycardia or heart block (during infusion, usually asymptomatic); hepatic toxicity (elevated LFTs); extravasation can cause tissue injury (though it's an irritant more than vesicant). Also risk of cumulative bone marrow suppression causing anemia/thrombocytopenia",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Paclitaxel is a plant-derived antineoplastic (from yew tree). It stabilizes polymerized microtubules and prevents their depolymerization, thereby disrupting the normal dynamic reorganization of microtubule network required for mitosis. This causes cell cycle arrest in metaphase and eventual apoptotic cell death. Essentially, it 'freezes' microtubules in place, inhibiting mitosis",
    "drug_interactions": "Drugs that inhibit CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 can affect paclitaxel clearance (e.g., ketoconazole can increase levels; rifampin can decrease levels); dosing sequence with cisplatin: if used together, give paclitaxel *before* cisplatin, because cisplatin can reduce paclitaxel clearance leading to increased toxicity&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52}; doxorubicin clearance is decreased by paclitaxel (if given closely, so in combos like AC->T, sequence and timing matter); paclitaxel can increase toxicity of radiation therapy if given concurrently (radiosensitizer); avoid live vaccines (chemo-induced immunosuppression). Grapefruit juice may increase levels (CYP3A4 inhib). Clozapine additive risk for agranulocytosis (rare, but both suppress bone marrow)."

    "name": "Avastin",
    "generic_name": "Bevacizumab",
    "manufacturer": "Genentech",
    "dosage": "Typically 5-15 mg/kg IV every 2 or 3 weeks depending on cancer type (e.g., 5 mg/kg q2w for metastatic colorectal with 5-FU, or 15 mg/kg q3w for lung cancer). For glioblastoma, 10 mg/kg q2w. Administer as IV infusion over 30-90 minutes (depending on dose and cycle number). Continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity",
    "indications": "Metastatic colorectal cancer (with chemotherapy); non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (with carboplatin/paclitaxel); metastatic renal cell carcinoma (with interferon alfa); recurrent glioblastoma (single agent); cervical cancer (persistent/recurrent/metastatic, with chemo); ovarian/fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer (with chemo for platinum-resistant or as maintenance in platinum-sensitive); also off-label in others. Also used intravitreally (off-label) for neovascular age-related macular degeneration, though not intravenous route for that",
    "contraindications": "Serious hemorrhage or recent hemoptysis in lung cancer (≥2.5 mL fresh blood); recent major surgery (within 28 days) or upcoming surgery (hold bevacizumab due to wound healing complications); uncontrolled hypertension; hypersensitivity to bevacizumab or Chinese hamster ovary cell products",
    "side_effects": "Hypertension (common, may need management); proteinuria (can lead to nephrotic syndrome, monitor urine protein); arterial thromboembolic events (stroke, MI); bleeding (mucosal, epistaxis common, but serious hemorrhage can occur especially pulmonary hemorrhage in lung cancer); wound healing complications (dehiscence); GI perforation (serious, sometimes fatal); infusion reactions (not as common as with chimeric mAbs); fatigue; minor bleeding (nosebleeds) in many patients; rare reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS)",
    "mechanism_of_action": "Humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). It binds VEGF and prevents it from interacting with its receptors on endothelial cells, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels). Tumors rely on angiogenesis for growth and metastasis, so bevacizumab can slow tumor growth by starving it of blood supply and also 'normalize' tumor vasculature to improve chemo delivery",
    "drug_interactions": "Increases risk of bleeding with anti-coagulants or NSAIDs (though not absolutely contraindicated, but caution); when combined with sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), there's a higher incidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (so careful monitoring); could potentiate risk of GI perforation when combined with inflammatory agents (like steroids or NSAIDs in some case reports); live vaccines should be avoided due to immunosuppressive effect of chemo regimens (bevacizumab itself not heavily immunosuppressive, but often given with chemo); combination with other chemotherapies can have overlapping toxicities (e.g., wound healing issues if combined with major surgery, etc.)."
