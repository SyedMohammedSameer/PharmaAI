      "dosage": "500-1000 mg orally every 4-6 hours as needed (max ~3000 mg per day for adults)",
      "indications": "Mild to moderate pain, fever reduction",
      "contraindications": "Severe hepatic impairment or active liver disease; hypersensitivity to acetaminophen",
      "side_effects": "Generally well tolerated; possible nausea, rash; hepatotoxicity in overdose",
      "mechanism_of_action": "Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system, leading to analgesic and antipyretic effects (with minimal anti-inflammatory action)",
      "drug_interactions": "Excessive alcohol use increases risk of liver damage; concurrent use with other acetaminophen-containing products can lead to overdose"

      "contraindications": "Active peptic ulcer disease, history of GI bleeding, severe heart failure, during last trimester of pregnancy",
      "side_effects": "Gastrointestinal distress, dizziness, hypertension, renal impairment with prolonged use",
      "mechanism_of_action": "Non-selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, blocking prostaglandin synthesis and reducing inflammation, pain, and fever",
      "drug_interactions": "Increased bleeding risk with anticoagulants, potential renal toxicity with ACE inhibitors or diuretics, may decrease effects of some antihypertensives"

      "mechanism_of_action": "Inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, leading to increased LDL receptor expression and reduced blood cholesterol levels",
      "drug_interactions": "Increased risk of myopathy with gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, erythromycin, clarithromycin; grapefruit juice can increase plasma concentration"

      "mechanism_of_action": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that blocks the reuptake of serotonin at the presynaptic membrane, increasing serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft",
      "drug_interactions": "Risk of serotonin syndrome with other serotonergic drugs, increased bleeding risk with NSAIDs or anticoagulants, may affect metabolism of drugs processed by CYP2D6"
